# Employee Data Modal

This project demonstrates how to fetch employee data from an API endpoint, parse the response data, create an HTML table dynamically, populate it with the retrieved data, and display the table in a modal or popup.

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Click the "Open Employee Data" button.

4. A modal window will appear displaying the employee data fetched from the API.

5. To close the modal, click outside of it or press the Escape key.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript

## API Endpoint

The code includes a placeholder response for the employee data. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the placeholder response with an actual HTTP request to the API endpoint.
